If there is any failure, the command will not finish saying OK but FAILED. We will now list the steps involved in the verification. For technical reasons the command doesn't follow the exact same order as listed in here, but we still list them this way for clarity:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Extract the file in a directory whose path is printed in the screen</li><li>\nShow in the screen briefly the most important data of the tally: number of votes and the list of winning options (NOT in order).</li><li>\nRead the result_json file that corresponds with the results of the tally shown in the previous step and hash it.</li><li>\nRead the publick keys with which the ballots where encrypted (file pubkeys_json)</li><li>\nRead the ballots from the file ciphertexts_json and check the validity of the Zero Knownledge Proofs (ZKP) mathematical proofs that prove that the person that encrypted the ballot knew the plain text content of the ballot.</li><li>\nThe next step is to verify some elements from each question. Each question is encrypted separately, and thus the tally and some verifications are made also separately:<ol><li>\nVerify that starting with the ballot of the file &quot;ciphertexts_json&quot; it can be obtained the encrypted ballot in raw format. A hash of both files is made and it is checked that the result is the same. If this verification fails, the script prints on the screen &quot;ciphertexts_json verification FAILED&quot;.</li><li>\nRead the ZKP proofs that mathematically prove that starting with the encrypted ballots of this question, the result is the decrypted ballots in raw format. If these proofs fail, the script prints &quot;verification FAILED&quot;.</li><li>\nVerify that the decrypted ballots in raw format can be converted in the result ballots in text format of the file &quot;plaintexts_json&quot;. A hash of both files is made and it is checked that both match. If this check fails, the script prints &quot;plaintexts_json verification FAILED&quot;.</li>\n</ol><li>\nRead the file that contains the decrypted votes, and calculate the tally of the election from that data.</li><li>\nCheck that the hash of that file matches the hash of  result_json obtained in step 3. If the comparison fails, the script prints &quot;tally verification FAILED&quot;.</li>\n</p>\n<p>As can be seen, <strong>it is mathematically and univocally proved</strong> that starting with the encrypted ballots, the election tally is correct. Some questions might be raised: where are all those ballots coming from? is my ballot included?</p><p>\n\nFirst, we have to say that the voting system implies the need of some trust in the organizations running the election, especially it is assumed that no ballot stuffing has not happened. This is a limitation (reflected in the <a href=\"https://agoravoting.com/static/generic_tech_overview_20_08_15.pdf\">tecnical overview</a>, section 6.3.3) that stems from the fact the ballots are not digitally signed, and they are not because very few people have a digital certificate that they can easily use in an election of this kind.In other european countries like for example Estonia, <a href=\"http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics\">e-ID seems to have widespread use and thus 24,3% of the electorate voted through Internet in 2011 elections</a>.</p><p>\n\nNevertheless, it can be mathematically proved that your individual ballot, the one that you cast as voter, is included in the list of encrypted ballots, in that list we have verified to generate the correct election result. To verify your vote, you need to have saved the ballot tracker, which is just a hash of the ballot. </p><p>\n\nThis ballot tracker appears in the screen when you finish the voting process of the voting booth. If you do not saved your ballot tracker, remember that you have to save it if you want to be able to perform this verification. </p><p>\n\nTo check that your ballot is included in the tally, you simply need to execute the same command as before, adding as a parameter your ballot tracker:</p>\n\n<code>\nsh agora-verifier {{electionId}}.tar [ballot-tracker]\n</code>\n"
